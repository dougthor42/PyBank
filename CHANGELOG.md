# ChangeLog

This is (will be) a record of all the changes made to the PyBank program. I
will begin logging changes once I have a beta release.

Items will be in reverse chronological order.

PyBank uses [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org) though since it's not an
API, ``MAJOR`` versions will be either a large collection of new features
or a major change to the back-end (or perhaps both). I do not plan on allowing
different ``MAJOR`` version to use the same .pybank file, but I also don't
plan on disallowing it.
